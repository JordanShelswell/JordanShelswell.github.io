I am a budding Environmental Professional with a background in horticulture and ecological restoration with an interest in technology. It is hard to put my various experiences succinctly, I have worked on small farms, in Ontarioâ€™s Parks Service and as a peer tutor and a information technology help desk worker. As such my skills encompass everything from groundwater remediation techniques and plant identification skills to web development, business planning and digital marketing.

What I lack in concentrated experience I make up in adaptability, cross discipline skills and the motivation to carry that forward into whatever comes next.

Feel free to check out this website, that is under ongoing development, and if you have any questions about what you see reach out to me through [LinkedIn][jordan-LinkedIn] or [email][jordan-email] and I would be happy to assist you.
