I am a budding Environmental Scientist with a focus on Ecological Restoration, Indigenous and Scientific Consultation and GIS with an interest in technology and environmental mechanics. It is hard to put my various experiences succinctly, I have worked on small farms, Ontarioâ€™s Parks Service and as a Peer Tutor and Technology Help Desk Worker. As such my skills encompass everything from groundwater remediation techniques and plant identification skills to web development, business planning, digital marketing and cartographic techniques What I lack in concentrated experience I make up in adaptability, Interdisciplinary skills and the motivation to carry that forward into whatever comes next.

Currently I am looking for opportunities to apply my skills in the Environmental Services, Public Service or Information Technology Industries and contemplating further formal education to become a registered Geo-scientist In Training or in a Technical/Analytical field(Bioinformatics, Engineering, Geophysics, GIS).
