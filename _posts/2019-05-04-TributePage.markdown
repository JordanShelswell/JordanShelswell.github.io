# Reasons
  I was looking for projects to practice web development languages and discovered freeCodeCamp.org. freeCodeCamp.org is a small non-profit organization that helps people learn to code. Their site ha a complete free programming course that shows you syntax in a logical and engaging way and then has you build projects from the ground up or forked from another project.

# Thoughts
  This project was my first recorded project and was created by forking the example page and playing with the css to create a style for the page. It was a simple exercise and was time spent playing with styling by objects, id's and classes and how text and box style objects behave differently.
