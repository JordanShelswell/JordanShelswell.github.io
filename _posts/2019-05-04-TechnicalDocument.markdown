# Reasons
  I was looking for projects to practice web development languages and discovered freeCodeCamp.org. freeCodeCamp.org is a small non-profit organization that helps people learn to code. Their site ha a complete free programming course that shows you syntax in a logical and engaging way and then has you build projects from the ground up or forked from another project.

# Thoughts
  In this project I focused on constructing html objects from the ground up and how css interacts with html objects to give a site page structure. The project was built systematically, first the design doc requirements were placed and organized then, nestled within each other when required. Then the larger pieces were assembled to bring it all together. A random Ipsum generator was used to fill in the text but additional styling was not implemented. This was to allow me to focus on the structural elements of the page without time diverted into extraneous code and allow the page to be quickly adapted and extended in the future.
