#### Reasons
  I was looking for projects to practice web development languages and discovered freeCodeCamp.org. freeCodeCamp.org is a small non-profit organization that helps people learn to code. Their site ha a complete free programming course that shows you syntax in a logical and engaging way and then has you build projects from the ground up or forked from another project.

#### Survey Form: CSS Exploration

<p class="codepen" data-height="400" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="jordanshelswell" data-slug-hash="PgqaKq" data-preview="true" style="height: 400 px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="FCC: SurveyFormTest">

#### Thoughts
  At the time I did not understand how the two columns worked so I forked the example project and combed through it to figure out how the project build document was implemented. I then styled the project to practice pure CSS.
