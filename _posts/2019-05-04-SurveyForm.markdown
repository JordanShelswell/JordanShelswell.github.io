# Reasons
  I was looking for projects to practice web development languages and discovered freeCodeCamp.org. freeCodeCamp.org is a small non-profit organization that helps people learn to code. Their site ha a complete free programming course that shows you syntax in a logical and engaging way and then has you build projects from the ground up or forked from another project.

# Survey Form: CSS Exploration
  You can find a live version of the project [here][project].

# Thoughts
  At the time I did not understand how the two columns worked so I forked the example project and combed through it to figure out how the project build document was implemented. I then styled the project to practice pure CSS.
