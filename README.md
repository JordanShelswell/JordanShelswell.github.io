# A Personal Website

This project is a personal web page that was created as a programming and
development exercise that incorporates web design, HTML, CSS, git, Ruby,
Google Analytics and more as a practical and constructive endeavor for a new
entrant into the world of coding.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes and includes links to further
documentation.

### Prerequisites

You need Ruby installed on your system and it can be obtained from https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
and the site contains instructions on installation and troubleshooting.

## Deployment
A quick and dirty means of local dev deployment for any Jekyll powered site
hosted on github pages.
Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop with 'gem install github-pages'.
This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including
Jekyll, Sass, etc.
Clone down your fork git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git.
Serve the site and watch for changes with 'jekyll serve'.
View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/.
Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user
repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.

Please refer to the Jekyll documentation for further on how to set up a local
dev environment on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
It can be found here https://jekyllrb.com/ and also includes instructions on how to
publish a site with Jekyll.
If you have any questions the documentation is very thorough and has helped immensely with the project.
